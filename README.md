# Roulette

This is a game of roulette. Roulette is a game of chance in which up to 5 players bet on cells with numbers from 0 to 9. Players select a box to bet on and if the selected number comes up, the winnings are split between everyone who bet on that number. If a number comes up that was not bet on, the casino takes the full amount of the bet.

__Features:__

- Betting system. At the beginning of each round, players bet on one or more cells numbered from 0 to 9.

- Game Settings. In the game you can choose the number of players from 1 to 5, the amount of the minimum and maximum bet and the starting balance of all players.
